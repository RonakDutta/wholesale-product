# Bug & Error Audit

This document records the issues found in the project and their current status.

## Summary

An earlier pass documented five suspected defects. On re-inspection, **all five had
already been fixed in the code**, but the messaging feature was still broken because
of separate root causes that the earlier pass did not catch. Those have now been
fixed.

| # | Issue | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| A | Socket.IO server never listens (`app.listen` instead of `httpServer.listen`) | **Fixed** |
| B | `messages` table has no migration (fresh DB has no table) | **Fixed** |
| C | Socket `send_message` handler drops `tempId`, breaking optimistic reconciliation | **Fixed** |
| D | `messagesRoutes` blocked brand-new conversations with a 403 | **Fixed** |
| E | Client dropped live messages on chats opened via URL (string/number id mismatch) | **Fixed** |
| 1 | Messaging routes not mounted | Already fixed (mounted in `app.js`) |
| 2 | Invalid payment lifecycle transition | Already fixed (order created as `payment_pending`) |
| 3 | Order endpoints missing ownership checks | Already fixed (`ensureOrderAccess`) |
| 4 | Dashboard sidebar state undefined | Already fixed (`isSidebarOpen` state present) |
| 5 | Seller-upgrade columns missing on fresh DB | Already fixed (`add_seller_profile_columns.sql`) |

## A) Socket.IO server was never listening (critical)

### Affected file

- [server/src/server.js](server/src/server.js)

### Problem

`Socket.IO` was attached to `httpServer` (`new Server(httpServer, ...)`), but the
process called `app.listen(PORT)` — starting a *second*, plain Express server with no
websocket support — instead of `httpServer.listen(PORT)`. As a result the websocket
endpoint was never bound, every client socket connection failed, and no message could
be sent or received in real time. The REST endpoints (`GET /api/messages/chats`, etc.)
appeared to work, which is why "the messaging feature is there but not working."

### Fix

Listen on `httpServer` so both the REST API and Socket.IO are served from the same
port. Also hardened the `send_message` handler with input validation and a
try/catch so a bad insert can no longer crash the process.

## B) `messages` table had no migration

### Affected files

- [server/migrations/messaging_system.sql](server/migrations/messaging_system.sql) (new)
- [server/run_migrations.js](server/run_migrations.js)

### Problem

The messages router and the socket handler read/write a `messages` table
(`sender_id`, `receiver_id`, `message_text`, `is_read`, `created_at`), but no
migration created it. On a fresh database every messaging query fails with
`relation "messages" does not exist`.

### Fix

Added `messaging_system.sql` creating the `messages` table and its indexes, and
updated `run_migrations.js` to apply **all** `.sql` files in `migrations/` (it
previously ran only `reviews_system.sql`, so new migrations were never applied).

---

## C) Optimistic message reconciliation was broken

### Affected files

- [server/src/server.js](server/src/server.js)
- [client/src/hooks/useConversation.jsx](client/src/hooks/useConversation.jsx)

### Problem

The client sends `{ receiverId, text, tempId }` and expects the `message_sent` echo
to carry `tempId` so it can swap the optimistic bubble for the real saved row. The
server destructured only `{ receiverId, text }` and echoed the DB row without
`tempId`, so the optimistic message was never reconciled.

### Fix

The server now echoes `tempId` back on `message_sent` and emits `message_error`
(with `tempId`) on failure; the client reconciles on success and removes the stuck
optimistic bubble on error.

---

## D) New conversations were blocked with a 403

### Affected file

- [server/src/routes/messagesRoutes.js](server/src/routes/messagesRoutes.js)

### Problem

`ensureConversationAccess` returned `403` whenever no message existed yet between the
two users, so a user could never *start* a chat. The client then stored the error
object in place of the message array, breaking the conversation view. The guard was
also redundant: every query is already scoped to the requesting user
(`WHERE (sender=me AND receiver=them) OR (sender=them AND receiver=me)`), so a user
can only ever read/modify their own messages.

### Fix

Removed the redundant guard. Brand-new conversations now return an empty array and
render the "Say hello" empty state; the integer/self-target validation is retained.

---

## E) Live messages dropped on URL-opened chats

### Affected file

- [client/src/hooks/useConversation.jsx](client/src/hooks/useConversation.jsx)

### Problem

`activeChatId` is a **string** when a chat is opened via `/messages/:vendorId` but a
**number** when selected from the chat list. The incoming-message filter compared it
strictly (`===`) against numeric DB ids, so real-time messages were dropped for
chats opened from a URL.

### Fix

Coerce the id with `Number(...)` before comparing.

## Validation

- Backend: `node --test tests/orderStatusService.test.js` → 3 passed, 0 failed.
- Frontend: `npm run build` → Vite production build succeeds.
