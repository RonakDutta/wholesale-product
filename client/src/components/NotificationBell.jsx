/**
 * The bell, and where its panel goes.
 *
 * CONTROLLED, because the navbar has to be able to shut it. It used to own its
 * open state, and the profile menu owned its own separately, so opening one did
 * not close the other: a person tapped his profile, then tapped the bell, and
 * got both flyouts stacked on top of each other. The navbar now holds one
 * "which menu is open" value and this is told.
 *
 * Each copy of this gets a DIFFERENT key from the navbar, which matters. The
 * navbar mounts two, one for phones and one for desktop, and hides the wrong
 * one with CSS. Sharing a single flag between them is what once broke the city
 * picker outright: the hidden copy's outside-click handler saw a click on the
 * visible copy as a click outside ITSELF and closed the menu on mousedown,
 * destroying the button before the mouseup could land on it. The listener
 * below is only attached while THIS copy is open, so a closed copy has no
 * handler to misfire.
 *
 * POSITIONED FROM THE BUTTON'S RECT, not with `absolute right-0`. That is what
 * it used to be, and since the bell is not the last icon in the row, a 358px
 * panel anchored to the bell's right edge hung 14px off the left of a 390px
 * screen. Measured, at 360 and 390 both. A fixed panel placed from the
 * button and clamped to the viewport cannot do that at any width, whatever
 * else moves into the row later.
