/**
 * Challans this customer or supplier is still waiting to be billed for.
 *
 * The whole reason a challan is worth recording. A wholesaler who sent goods
 * out three times last week should not have to remember that when he comes to
 * bill them, and should certainly not have to retype the items.
 *
 * Ticking one loads its lines into the form, where they can be changed like
 * any other line, and the ids ride along with the sale or purchase so the
 * server can close them in the same transaction that writes the bill. That is
 * Marg's flow: pick the challan, it loads into the bill screen, adjust, save.
 *
 * Nothing here prices anything. The form does that, through the one path that
 * already knows about GST, cess and the rest.
 *
 * `autoSelect` is a challan id arriving from the URL, which is what the Make
 * the bill button on a challan sends. It ticks that one row the moment the
 * list lands, so the wholesaler arrives at a form already filled in rather
 * than at a form where he has to find and tick the challan he just came from.
 * It fires once per form: after that the ticks are his.
