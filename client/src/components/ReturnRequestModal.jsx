/**
 * Asking to send goods back.
 *
 * There was no screen for this at all. The route existed, set a flag nobody
 * read, and left the order sitting at "delivered", so a buyer had no way to
 * ask and a wholesaler had no way to hear.
 *
 * A reason is required and the box is the whole point of the screen. It is
 * the only thing the wholesaler has to go on when he decides, and the
 * difference between "short by four metres, dyeing is off on the second
 * piece" and no explanation at all is the difference between a return settled
 * on WhatsApp in a minute and an argument.
 *
 * It is careful not to promise money back. Accepting a return stops the
 * customer owing for the goods; whether cash already handed over comes back,
 * and when, is between the two of them.
