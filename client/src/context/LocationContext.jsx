/**
 * Which city the buyer is shopping in.
 *
 * The navbar picker used to be a piece of local state next to a list of ten
 * big Indian cities, and nothing read it. Picking Surat changed the label and
 * nothing else, so a buyer was shown the whole country while believing he was
 * being shown one city.
 *
 * Two things are deliberate here.
 *
 * The cities come from the server, built from listings that actually exist. A
 * fixed list offers Bangalore whether or not one wholesaler there has listed
 * anything, and an empty result gives the buyer no way to tell whether he
 * filtered wrongly or the shop is broken.
 *
 * The default is the whole country, not a city. Guessing a buyer's city from
 * his IP address or from the top of the list hides stock from him without his
 * ever having asked for that, and the hiding is invisible.
