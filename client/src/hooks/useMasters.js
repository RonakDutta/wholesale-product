/**
 * The platform masters: units, tax slabs, states, HSN codes.
 *
 * These were constants in this client until 12 Sept. They now come from tables
 * a platform admin can edit, so correcting a unit or adding a GST slab stops
 * being a deploy.
 *
 * THE CONSTANTS ARE STILL HERE, as the floor. Migrations in this repository are
 * run by hand, so the client is routinely live against a server whose database
 * has not had the SQL applied. A product form that cannot offer a unit is worse
 * than one offering a list that is a week out of date, and these are the lists
 * the product has been running on all along.
 *
 * Fetched once per page load and shared through a module level promise rather
 * than a context, because four screens want it, it never changes while somebody
 * is filling in a form, and a context provider around the whole app for two
 * dropdowns is more machinery than the job needs.
