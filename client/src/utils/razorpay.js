/**
 * Loading Razorpay's checkout script.
 *
 * Their window is an iframe served from checkout.razorpay.com, and that is the
 * whole reason to use theirs rather than draw our own: card numbers and UPI
 * PINs are entered inside a document we do not control and never touch our
 * code. A convincing local imitation of it, which is what this replaced, gets
 * the look right and the security exactly backwards.
 *
 * Loaded on demand rather than from index.html. Most people who open this app
 * never reach a payment screen, and a third party script in the document head
 * is a request on every page load and a name in the global scope for the whole
 * session.
 *
 * The promise is cached, so two buttons pressed quickly share one load. A
 * FAILED load is not cached: the usual reason is a flaky connection or a
 * blocker, and both can be gone by the time he presses it again.
