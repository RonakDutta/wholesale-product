-- Run each section in the Neon SQL Editor and share the output.
-- Section 1 alone answers most questions; 2-4 cover relations and rules.
-- =====================================================

-- 1) Every table with its columns, types, nullability and defaults

-- 2) Foreign keys: which column points at which table/column

  AND tc.table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY tc.table_name, kcu.column_name;


-- 3) All CHECK / UNIQUE / PRIMARY KEY constraints with their definitions.
--    This is what reveals things like chk_order_status.
SELECT
  rel.relname       AS table_name,
  con.conname       AS constraint_name,

-- 4) Row counts, to know which tables actually hold data
SELECT relname AS table_name, n_live_tup AS approx_rows
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY relname;
