-- =====================================================
-- DRIVER TRACKING LINKS
--
-- Live location without asking a driver to install anything, and without the
-- wholesaler typing coordinates by hand.
--
-- The wholesaler generates a link and sends it over WhatsApp/SMS. The driver
-- opens it in whatever browser their phone has and taps once to share
-- location; the page then posts positions while it stays open. No account, no
-- app, no background-location permission — which is what makes it realistic,
-- since drivers are rarely platform users.
--
-- The token is the credential, so links are scoped to one order and expire.
