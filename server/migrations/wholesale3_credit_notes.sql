-- Wholesale 3.0: credit notes.
--
-- Until now, reversing a bill meant marking the invoice Cancelled. That is
-- the wrong instrument once the bill has left the building. Under section 34
-- of the CGST Act, when an invoice has been issued and the supply is later
-- cancelled, the goods come back, or the value charged turns out to be more
-- than what was payable, the supplier issues a CREDIT NOTE. The invoice
-- stands. The credit note is the document that reverses it, and it is the
-- document the customer needs for his own books.
--
-- Four things here are decisions, not plumbing.
--
-- 1. Its own number series, per wholesaler, kept in credit_note_sequences.
--    A credit note may not borrow the invoice series: GST wants each document
--    type in its own consecutive run, and reusing invoice numbers would leave
--    gaps in the invoice run that look like missing bills.
--
-- 2. The recipient is SNAPSHOT here too, for the same reason it is snapshot
--    onto invoices. Editing a customer's GSTIN today must not rewrite a credit
--    note raised last year.
--
-- 3. The lines are copied rather than joined. The credit note has to say what
--    was credited even if the sale is later edited, and quantity is NUMERIC
--    rather than the INTEGER that invoice_items uses, so 2.5 metres does not
--    become 3 on the way through.
--
-- 4. One credit note per invoice, enforced by a unique index. Every credit
--    note this file supports reverses the whole invoice, so a second one
--    would credit the same goods twice. Partial credits, for a part return or
--    a rate correction, will relax that index and add a quantity to each line;
--    the shape here is built so that is an addition rather than a rewrite.
--
-- Run by hand against Neon, like every other file in this directory.
