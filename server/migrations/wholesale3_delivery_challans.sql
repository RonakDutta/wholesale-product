-- Wholesale 3.0: delivery challans.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS, AND A WARNING THAT GOES WITH IT
--
-- Built to a specification given on 10 Sept 2026: when goods go out and the
-- full amount has not been received, the wholesaler gets a DELIVERY CHALLAN
-- instead of a tax invoice, and the invoice is raised only once the money is
-- in. The challan carries no tax.
--
-- That is not what the CGST Act says, and the wholesaler asking for it knows:
-- it is going to his legal advisor before this reaches production, and the
-- rules here are expected to change. Recording the gap so nobody builds on
-- this shape believing it is settled law:
--
--   Section 31(1) ties the tax invoice to REMOVAL of the goods, not to
--   payment. For a credit sale the invoice is due before or at the time the
--   goods leave. Issuing only a challan understates outward supply in GSTR-1
--   and leaves the customer unable to claim input credit.
--
--   Rule 55 challans are for movement that is NOT a supply: job work, goods
--   on approval, quantity unknown at removal. Rule 55(2) also wants three
--   copies, and tax shown where the movement IS a supply.
--
-- So this table deliberately does NOT model Rule 55. It models the document
-- that was asked for. `is_rule_55` is here so that if the advisor says the
-- real thing is wanted, the two can live side by side rather than one being
-- retrofitted over the other.
--
-- The whole feature sits behind FEATURES.CHALLAN_WHEN_UNPAID on the client
-- and `challanEnabled()` on the server, so it can be switched off in one word
-- without unpicking anything.
--
-- FOUR DECISIONS, not plumbing:
--
-- 1. Its own number series per wholesaler, in delivery_challan_sequences.
--    A challan may not borrow the invoice run: gaps in the invoice series
--    look like missing bills, and the two documents are counted separately.
--
-- 2. The recipient is SNAPSHOT, the same as invoices and credit notes.
--    Editing a customer today must not rewrite a challan issued last month.
--
-- 3. Lines are copied, not joined, and quantity is NUMERIC(12,3) so 2.5
--    metres does not become 3. There is no tax column at all, by instruction:
--    a challan here carries value only.
--
-- 4. Many challans per sale is ALLOWED, unlike credit notes. Goods can go out
--    in more than one lot against one sale, which is ordinary wholesale, and
--    a unique index would make the second lorry impossible.
--
-- RUN wholesale3_parties_and_sales.sql FIRST. This references sales, parties
-- and orders.
--
-- Run by hand against Neon, like every other file in this directory.
