-- Platform masters, and the super admin who owns them.
--
-- A master is a thing that EXISTS, as against a transaction, which is a thing
-- that HAPPENS. Everything here belongs to the PLATFORM rather than to any one
-- wholesaler: the state list, the units, the tax slabs, the HSN codes. Today
-- each of them is a constant in the code, so correcting one is a deploy.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not switch anything over. Every reader keeps
-- its constant as a fallback and probes for these tables the same way the rest
-- of this codebase probes for a migration it cannot assume has been run. Until
-- this file is applied the product behaves exactly as it does today; after it
-- is applied the tables win. Migrations here are run by hand, so code shipping
-- before its SQL is the normal case and not an edge one.
--
-- Safe to run more than once.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. The super admin
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- A flag, not a fourth role. users.role carries a CHECK allowing buyer, seller
-- and both, and an admin is not a fourth kind of trader: he is a person with
-- one extra permission. Widening that enum would put every `role = 'seller'`
-- test in the codebase back in question for no gain.
--
-- promotionController already tests for role 'admin', which the constraint can
-- never contain, so that code has been unreachable rather than merely unbuilt.
-- It reads this flag now.
--
-- There is no way to make the FIRST admin from inside the product, by design.
-- Bootstrap it by hand, once, the same way these migrations are run:
--
--   UPDATE users SET is_platform_admin = TRUE WHERE email = 'you@example.com';

-- 2. The masters

--
-- Every one carries `active` rather than being deleted. A unit or an HSN code
-- in use on an invoice already issued must not vanish from that document
-- because somebody tidied a list a year later.

-- States and union territories, with the two digit code that opens every
-- GSTIN. This code is what decides CGST plus SGST against IGST, so it is a
-- number on a legal document rather than a label.

--

-- price slab. Anything that maps an HSN to a GST rate is inventing a number
-- somebody will put on a tax document.
--
-- `source` says where a row came from. 'curated' is the short textile list this
-- product has always shipped, labelled as common rather than as verified;
-- 'admin' is a row a platform admin added. Suggestions drawn from a
-- wholesaler's own history are not stored here at all, because those are his.
