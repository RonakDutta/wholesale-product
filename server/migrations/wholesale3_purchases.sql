-- Wholesale 3.0: the purchase side of the book.
--
-- Everything so far records goods going OUT. A wholesaler also buys, from
-- mills, from agents, from other wholesalers, and until now none of that was
-- anywhere in the product. That leaves two holes that matter to a real trader:
--
--   * He cannot see what he OWES. The customer book answers "who owes me",
--     and the other half of a trader's day is the other direction.
--   * He cannot claim his input tax credit. GST is paid on the difference,
--     so the tax on his purchases is money back. With no purchase record
--     there is nothing to set against the tax he has charged.
--
-- This is deliberately the MIRROR of the sales spine, not a new idea:
--
--     parties          ->  suppliers
--     sales            ->  purchases
--     sale_lines       ->  purchase_lines
--     party_payments   ->  supplier_payments      (money out, not in)
--     sale_sequences   ->  purchase_sequences
--
-- Run by hand against Neon, like every other file in this directory.
-- Safe to run more than once.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY A SEPARATE suppliers TABLE RATHER THAN A COLUMN ON parties
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Adding `kind` to parties was the first idea and it is the wrong one. A party
-- row means "this man owes me", and that meaning is baked into seventeen
-- queries across five files: the customer list, the overview totals, the
-- statement, the credit service, khataBalance. Every one of them would need a
-- new filter, and the first one missed puts a supplier in the customer list
-- with his balance pointing the wrong way.
--
-- The cost of a separate table is that a firm a wholesaler both buys from and
-- sells to is two rows. That is the same trade parties already made when it
-- decided a party is private to one wholesaler, and it fails in the safe
-- direction: two rows that should be one is untidy, one row standing for two
-- relationships with opposite signs is a wrong balance.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- STOCK IS NOT MOVED. The obvious next thought is that a purchase should raise
-- stock. It must not, yet, because a sale does not lower it: sale_lines stores
-- an item name as text and touches no inventory row. Wiring one side only
-- gives a stock figure that climbs forever and is wrong in one direction from
-- the first purchase onward, which is worse than the honest nothing there is
-- today. Both sides move together or neither does.
--
-- NO INVOICE IS RAISED. A purchase bill is the supplier's document, not ours.
-- What is stored here is a copy of what he handed over, which is why the
-- supplier's own number and date are columns.
