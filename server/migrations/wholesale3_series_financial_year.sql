-- Sale and delivery challan numbers restart each financial year, like the
-- invoice already does.
--
-- WHY. The three documents were numbered three different ways:
--
--   invoice   INV-000001   counter keyed on wholesaler AND financial year
--   sale      S-0001       counter keyed on wholesaler only, never restarts
--   challan   DC-0001      counter keyed on wholesaler only, never restarts
--
-- so a wholesaler saw three shapes with three padding widths, none of them
-- saying which year the document belonged to. Asked about on 12 Sept, in his
-- words: "invoice dc, sales just starts with random 001 and then 002, so
-- weird".
--
-- The invoice now reads INV/1/26-27, which is the shape every Indian
-- accounting package writes and which Busy's own sample uses. This gives the
-- other two the same treatment: S/1/26-27 and DC/1/26-27, restarting each
-- 1 April.
--
-- Unlike the invoice series this is NOT a legal requirement. Rule 46(b)
-- constrains the tax invoice; a sale is the wholesaler's own record and a
-- delivery challan under this product's rule is explicitly not a tax document.
-- The reason to do it is that three documents describing the same goods should
-- not be numbered three different ways.
--
-- WHAT HAPPENS TO NUMBERS ALREADY ISSUED. Nothing. Rows already in `sales` and
-- `delivery_challans` keep the number printed on them; a document that has
-- gone out cannot be renumbered. Only the counter changes, and existing
-- counters are carried into the CURRENT financial year rather than reset, so
-- nobody's next sale collides with one he issued last week.
--
-- Safe to run more than once.
