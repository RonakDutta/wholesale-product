-- Staff accounts: a wholesaler's employees, working on his book.
--
-- Until now every employee used the owner's own login. Nothing in any history
-- could say who actually did a thing, and an owner could not take access back
-- from somebody who had left without changing his own password and telling
-- everybody else the new one.

-- One row per employment, not per person. The person is a normal user in
-- `users` and signs in the ordinary way; this table is what points his session
-- at his employer's customers, sales and stock instead of at an empty book of
-- his own.
