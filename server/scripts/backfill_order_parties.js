/**
 * Put every existing order into its wholesaler's customer book.
 *
 * Orders placed before the book existed have no party. This walks them oldest
 * first and assigns one, using exactly the same matching a new checkout uses,
 * so a buyer who already appears in the diary by phone number lands on that
 * row rather than getting a second one.
 *
 * Safe to run more than once: it only touches orders where party_id is null.
 *
