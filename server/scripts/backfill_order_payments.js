/**
 * Bring marketplace payments that already happened into the khata.
 *
 * Every settled payment_transactions row becomes a party_payments row against
 * the customer its order belongs to, so the customer page and the statement
 * account for money taken before the two ledgers were joined.
 *
 * Safe to run more than once: the unique index on payment_transaction_id
 * refuses a second row for the same payment, so a repeat run reports
 * everything as already done rather than doubling anyone's credit.
 *
 * Run scripts/backfill_order_parties.js first. A payment can only be filed
 * under a customer once its order knows which customer it belongs to.
 *
 *     node scripts/backfill_order_payments.js --dry    report, change nothing
 *     node scripts/backfill_order_payments.js          do it
