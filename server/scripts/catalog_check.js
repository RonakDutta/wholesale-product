/**
 * Can a wholesaler who has not filled in his business details sell anything?
 *
 * The catalogue used to inner join wholesaler_profiles, so a seller who had
 * signed up but not completed his profile had every listing vanish from
 * search, from the product page and from the shop page. No error and no empty
 * state: the products simply were not there, and he had no way to find out
 * why. A new seller's first hour is exactly when that row is least likely to
 * exist.
