/**
 * Every way a wholesaler can reach for a challan or a bill, exhaustively.
 *
 * challan_check.js walks the story: unpaid, half paid, paid, billed. This
 * walks the grid instead. For a sale that is one of four statuses and one of
 * three settlement states, and for an order at each point of its lifecycle,
 * it asks both questions and pins both answers:
 *
 *   can goods go out on a delivery challan?
 *   can a tax invoice be raised?
 *
 * Twelve sale cells, a dozen order cells, plus the switches around them: the
 * feature flag off, the migration not run, a bad reason, another wholesaler's
 * sale, a sale with no lines. Written because "nothing is left behind" is a
 * claim that can only be made by trying every box, and several of these were
 * never tried before.
 *
 * The rule under test is the one specified on 10 Sept 2026 and is expected to
 * change after legal review. See the header of challanService.js.
 *
