/**
 * Why does this customer's balance say what it says?
 *
 * A negative balance means the wholesaler has taken more money from someone
 * than he has billed him for. That is sometimes exactly right, an advance or
 * a payment against an order that was later cancelled, and sometimes it is old
 * test data from a prototype that was never real business.
 *
 * This tells the two apart by showing every figure the balance is made of,
 * rather than leaving anyone to guess at it.
 *
 *     node scripts/explain_balance.js              every customer in credit
 *     node scripts/explain_balance.js <party-id>   one customer in full
