/**
 * Does the bill say the same thing the order said?
 *
 * A wholesaler saw one name on his Orders tab and a different name on his
 * Invoices tab, for the same goods and the same customer. Two separate faults
 * were behind it, and both are checked here.
 *
 * 1. The order screen reads `wholesaler_profiles.company_name` off the buyer's
 *    account. The invoice reads the party, and the party created at checkout
 *    was given the delivery address name and nothing else: no firm, no GST
 *    number. So the orders tab said "Kishan Cloth House" and the invoice said
 *    "Kishan Kumar". The missing GST number was the worse half, because a bill
 *    without it is a bill the customer cannot claim input credit against.
 *
 * 2. There were genuinely two invoices. Checkout raises one from the order in
 *    the background, and pressing "raise bill" on the sale raised another,
 *    because that path only looked for an invoice against the sale and the
 *    order's invoice carries no sale_id. One lot of goods, two numbers, two
 *    rows in the tab, under two different names.
 *
 * The rule this pins down: one lot of goods has one bill, addressed to the
 * firm when there is one, and nothing an order does may overwrite what the
 * wholesaler wrote in his own book.
