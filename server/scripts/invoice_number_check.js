/**
 * Does each wholesaler get his own unbroken run of invoice numbers?
 *
 * The counter was keyed on the year alone, so one run served the whole
 * platform: Ram billed and got 000001, Suresh billed and got 000002, Ram
 * billed again and got 000003. Each man's own book had holes in it, and the
 * size of each hole told him how much business the other had done.
 *
 * Rule 46(b) wants a consecutive serial number per supplier, so this bills
 * alternately as two wholesalers and checks each one's numbers come out 1, 2,
 * 3 with nothing missing.
 *
 *     node scripts/invoice_number_check.js <database>
