/**
 * Move the rate list into the shop listings, so there is one product list.
 *
 * For every row in a wholesaler's rate list this either fills in an existing
 * listing of the same product, or creates one. It never creates a second
 * listing for something he already sells, and it never overwrites a value he
 * has already set in the shop.
 *
 * Two decisions worth knowing before running it:
 *
 *   New listings are created PRIVATE. A rate list is not a shop window. A
 *   wholesaler who has been keeping private prices would otherwise find his
 *   whole book public the moment this ran, which is the exact leak
 *   supplier_inventory.visibility exists to prevent. He turns on the ones he
 *   wants to sell publicly, product by product.
 *
 *   Nothing is deleted. The items rows stay exactly where they are, so this
 *   can be checked afterwards and reversed by clearing source_item_id.
 *
 * Safe to run more than once: matching is on source_item_id first, and a
 * unique index backs that up.
 *
 *     node scripts/merge_items_into_listings.js --dry    report, change nothing
 *     node scripts/merge_items_into_listings.js          do it
