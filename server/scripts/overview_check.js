/**
 * Does the Overview agree with the customer page about money?
 *
 * It did not, and the way it failed was the worst kind: a plausible number
 * with a minus in front of it. The Overview billed from sales alone but
 * subtracted every payment including the ones taken through the shop, so a
 * wholesaler whose customers had paid through the marketplace was shown a
 * negative amount still to collect. The payment came off the total and the
 * order behind it was never added on.
 *
 * So this does not check the Overview against a figure typed into this file.
 * It checks it against the customer pages, one by one, because two screens
 * answering the same question differently is the actual bug.
 *
