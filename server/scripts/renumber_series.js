/**
 * Renumber documents already issued into the new scheme.
 *
 * On 12 Sept all three series moved to prefix / serial / financial year:
 * INV/1/26-27, S/1/26-27, DC/1/26-27, restarting each 1 April. That changed
 * what NEW documents get. Everything already written kept the number printed
 * on it: INV-000001, S-0001, DC-0001.
 *
 * This brings the old ones across, for a database where that is the right
 * thing to do.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * READ THIS BEFORE POINTING IT AT ANYTHING REAL
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Sales and challans are the wholesaler's own records. Renumbering them
 * changes nothing outside his own book and is safe.
 *
 * A TAX INVOICE IS NOT. Its number is what the customer's books reference and
 * what his input tax credit is claimed against. Renumbering one that has
 * already gone out means his records point at a number that no longer exists,
 * and under Rule 46(b) the serial is supposed to be fixed for the financial
 * year. This script will do it because it was asked for against test data, and
 * it says so every time it runs. Use --skip-invoices to leave them alone.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOW IT NUMBERS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Documents are ordered by their own date, then by when the row was written,
 * and numbered 1, 2, 3 within each financial year they fall in. So a sale
 * dated March 2026 lands in 25-26 and one dated April 2026 in 26-27, each with
 * its own run starting at 1. That is what the live counters now do, so the
 * renumbered history and everything issued afterwards form one series.
 *
 * Invoices use the wholesaler's OWN saved prefix and suffix, through the same
 * compose() the live code uses, so a wholesaler who set OM/ and /{FY} gets
 * OM/1/26-27 rather than whatever this script would have picked. The result is
 * checked against Rule 46(b) before it is written; an illegal one stops the
 * whole run rather than being quietly truncated.
 *
 * Renaming happens in two passes inside one transaction, because going
 * straight from S-0002 to S/1/26-27 can collide with a row this run has not
 * reached yet. Pass one moves every row to a temporary number, pass two puts
 * the real one on. Both numbers are unique per wholesaler, so nothing outside
 * his book can be disturbed.
 *
 * The counters are then set to the highest number in each year, so the next
 * document continues the run rather than colliding with it.
