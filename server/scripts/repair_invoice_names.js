/**
 * Fix the customer names already stored wrong.
 *
 * The code fix only helps orders placed from now on. This is for the rows
 * already in the database, and it is deliberately three separate things,
 * because they carry three different levels of risk.
 *
 *   1  parties     fill a blank firm name or GST number from the account the
 *                  party is already linked to. Blanks only, never an
 *                  overwrite, so nothing the wholesaler typed is touched.
 *                  Low risk: this is his own customer's own details.
 *
 *   2  invoices    re-address an invoice that was made out to the person when
 *                  his firm is now known, and fill a blank GST number. Only
 *                  where the stored name is exactly the party's contact name,
 *                  so an invoice a wholesaler addressed by hand is left alone.
 *                  HIGHER RISK: these are issued tax documents. If one has
 *                  already been handed to a customer, its replacement should
 *                  match what he holds. Read the dry run before applying.
 *
 *   3  duplicates  REPORT ONLY. Orders holding more than one invoice, from
 *                  before the two billing paths were made to agree. Nothing is
 *                  merged automatically: payments may be split across the two,
 *                  and deciding which number stands, and moving the payments,
 *                  is a person's job. See the notes it prints.
 *
 * Dry run by default. Nothing is written without --apply.
 *
 *     node scripts/repair_invoice_names.js            # show what would change
 *     node scripts/repair_invoice_names.js --apply    # do parts 1 and 2
 *
 * Reads DATABASE_URL, so it talks to whatever the server talks to. Safe to run
 * more than once: every statement filters on the broken state.
