/**
 * Clear the books and start fresh, keeping the shop.
 *
 * Asked for on 11 Sept 2026, before production, after a run of balances that
 * could not be reconciled because the code that made them has since changed.
 * The quickest honest answer to inconsistent test data is to stop trying to
 * repair it and begin again with the rules that are now in place.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELETES
 *   every order, and everything hanging off one: items, status history,
 *   payment transactions, shipments, tracking links, checkpoints, reviews
 *   every sale and its lines
 *   every invoice, its items, its logs and its payments
 *   every credit note and delivery challan, and their numbering counters
 *   every customer in the khata and every payment recorded against one
 *
 * WHAT IT KEEPS
 *   login accounts, the business profile, staff and their permissions
 *   products and shop listings
 *   invoice settings: prefix, due days, default tax rate, terms
 *   notification preferences and device tokens
 *
 * STOCK IS NOT PUT BACK. Ordering reserves stock off a listing, and nothing
 * records what the figure was before. Deleting the orders cannot undo the
 * reservation without inventing a number, so it does not try: after running
 * this, go through Products and set the stock figures to what is actually on
 * the shelf. The script prints every listing and its current figure so there
 * is a list to work from.
 *
 * It is scoped to ONE wholesaler, by email, so a shared database is not
 * emptied by a wholesaler clearing his own books.
 *
 *     node scripts/reset_books.js <DATABASE_URL> <email>            # dry run
 *     node scripts/reset_books.js <DATABASE_URL> <email> --write    # do it
 *
 * The dry run is the default and changes nothing. It prints exactly what the
 * real run would delete, counted from the database rather than guessed.
