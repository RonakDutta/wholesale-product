/**
 * When does an order stop being undoable, and does the money follow it back?
 *
 * Two things were missing.
 *
 * The return door never shut. `delivered` is `delivered` whether the goods
 * arrived this morning or last February, so an order from a year ago could
 * still be sent back and the wholesaler had nothing to point at when he said
 * no. The clock is a separate question from the lifecycle and had never been
 * asked. orders.actual_delivery_date existed from the beginning with nothing
 * ever writing to it, which is why there was no date to ask about.
 *
 * The cancel door was ajar in a way the buttons hid. The refuse button stops
 * at packed, but the status map allowed cancelled from packed, ready_for_pickup
 * and shipped, and the generic status route writes whatever it is passed. So
 * an order already with a driver could be killed by posting a status directly.
 *
 * And the last step of a return, return_completed to refunded, existed in the
 * lifecycle and nothing had ever called it, so every returned order stopped one
 * step short with the customer's money still in the till and no way to clear
 * the line that said so.
