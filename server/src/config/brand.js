 *
 * Used for what goes out under the platform's own name: email headers, the
 * welcome notification, and the fallback on a document when a wholesaler has
 * not filled in his own company name.
 *
 * "Marketplace" as an ordinary noun, meaning the browsing and ordering half of
 * the product, is not the brand and is left alone.
