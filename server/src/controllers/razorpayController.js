 * The three endpoints a Razorpay checkout needs.
 *
 *   POST /api/orders/:orderId/razorpay/order    open a gateway order
 *   POST /api/orders/:orderId/razorpay/simulate stub only: act as the gateway
 *   POST /api/orders/:orderId/razorpay/verify   check the handler payload
 *
 * See services/razorpayService.js for what is and is not built. The short
 * version is that verification is real in both modes and order creation is a
 * stub, so nothing here can be mistaken for a working gateway.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SETTLES MONEY ITSELF. Once a signature checks out, this hands
 * over to orderController.updatePaymentStatus, which is the one place that
 * knows how much is actually owed, caps a payment at it, mirrors it into the
 * customer's khata, reconciles the invoice and moves the order's status. A
 * second settlement path would be a second set of those rules, and this
 * codebase has been bitten by exactly that more than once.
