/**
 * Razorpay talking to the server directly, rather than through the buyer.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS HAS TO EXIST ONCE REAL MONEY MOVES
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Settlement used to depend entirely on the browser posting back to /verify
 * after checkout. That is Razorpay's own "hint", and it is lost whenever the
 * buyer's browser dies, his phone sleeps mid-UPI, or he closes the tab on the
 * bank's page. The money moved and the order did not, and nobody found out
 * until he complained.
 *
 * That was survivable while every rupee sat in one account a person could
 * reconcile by hand. With Route it is not: the money has already been
 * transferred to the wholesaler, who has an order still showing unpaid.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It does not settle money itself, any more than the verify endpoint does.
 * Once an event is genuine it hands over to orderController.updatePaymentStatus,
 * which is the one place that knows what is owed, caps a payment at it,
 * mirrors it into the khata, reconciles the invoice and moves the order's
 * status. A second settlement path would be a second set of those rules.
 */

/**
 * Every delivery is recorded before it is acted on, and the unique index on
 * event_id is what makes a retry harmless.
 *
 * Razorpay retries until it gets a 2xx, and a retry after a slow success is
 * ordinary. Without this, a buyer's payment could be applied twice.
