 * Works out whose book this request is acting on, and what the person may do.

 * Sets `req.business`:
 *
 *   { id, isOwner, staffId, name, permissions }
 *
 * `id` is the wholesaler. For an owner it is his own id, which is why the
 * distinction was invisible before and why `req.user.id` was doing both jobs.
 * For an employee it is his employer's, and that one substitution is what
 * turns every seller screen into his employer's book rather than an empty one
 * of his own.
 *
 * Runs after authenticateToken and needs nothing from the route. Controllers
 * read `businessId(req)` rather than `req.user.id` wherever they mean the
 * business; where they genuinely mean the person, notifications, messages, the
 * name against a history row, they keep reading `req.user.id`.
