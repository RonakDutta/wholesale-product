 * Is this person a platform admin?

 * Read from the database on every admin request, not from the token.
 *
 * Putting the flag in the JWT would be cheaper and is the obvious thing to do,
 * and it is wrong here for two reasons. Tokens already issued would not carry
 * it, so nobody could be made an admin without signing out and in again. Worse,
 * taking the flag AWAY would not take effect until the token expired, which
 * means a revoked admin keeps every power he had for as long as his session
 * lasts. For a permission that edits the tax slabs and the state list, that is
 * not a trade worth making for one small query.
 *
 * The column arrives with wholesale3_platform_masters.sql. Until that has been
 * run the answer is no for everybody, which is the safe direction: the admin
 * screens are simply unreachable rather than open.
