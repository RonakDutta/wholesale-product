   * THE RACE THIS CLOSES
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * A bill raised from a shop order has TWO writers. `reconcileInvoiceForOrder`
   * mirrors what the order has received, and it runs in the BACKGROUND off
   * every payment event. A wholesaler recording the same money by hand is the
   * other. Reconcile was idempotent only in one direction: it refuses to add
   * when enough is already on the bill, but if it got there FIRST the hand
   * entry landed afterwards and nothing ever looked again.
   *
   * One instalment of 510 on a 1,020 order then showed as 1,020 received, and
   * the bill read fully paid with half still owed. It reproduced about one run
   * in three under load, which is why it went unnoticed: on an idle machine
   * the hand entry almost always won the race and reconcile then saw it.
   *
   * The fix is a CEILING both writers obey, taken under the same advisory lock
   * reconcile already uses, so whichever arrives second sees the first. For an
   * order backed invoice the ceiling is what the ORDER says has been received,
   * because the order is the authority over money that came in through the
   * shop. That is the same rule the sale side states as FOLLOWS_ORDER.
   *
   * Returns null when there is nothing left to record. Callers facing a person
   * turn that into a sentence; reconcile never sees it, because it works out
   * its own gap first and passes a figure that already fits.

     * "26-27" would still say 26-27 next April, which is a wrong year on a
     * legal document.

     * Padding drops to zero because the year already makes the number read as
     * a series. INV/1/26-27 is ten characters and leaves room to grow inside

     * at all.

     * somebody who has never opened the screen gets.
