/**
 * The challan as a document in its own right, in two directions.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. The first challan, built 10 Sept, was PAYMENT driven:
 * it was raised because a sale was not fully paid, and it held the tax
 * invoice back until the money came in. That is not what a challan is
 * anywhere else in Indian trade, and it conflated two different documents.
 *
 * In Marg the pair is Sale Challan and Purchase Challan, entered under
 * Transactions and converted into a Sale Bill or Purchase Bill afterwards. In
 * Tally the same pair is Delivery Note and Receipt Note, linked to the
 * invoice by a Tracking Number. In Busy it is Material Issued to Party and
 * Material Received from Party. In all three the challan is MOVEMENT driven:
 * it exists because goods moved, before any bill, and it does not care
 * whether anybody has paid.
 *
 * THE ACCOUNTING RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP. A challan NEVER touches the
 * party's balance and carries no GST. The money starts existing when the bill
 * is raised from it. A challan that also moved the ledger would have every
 * sale counted twice in the khata, once when the goods left and again when
 * the bill went out, and the error would be invisible because both entries
 * would look correct on their own.
 *
 * IT DOES MOVE STOCK, since 18 Sept, and that is the only thing besides the
 * document itself that it moves. For most of this file's life the header
 * claimed this and the code did not do it: nothing in the khata moved stock at
 * all. `services/stockLedger.js` is the ledger it writes to now, and the
 * quantity on hand is the SUM of those rows rather than a stored counter.
 *
 * WHICH IS NOT `supplier_inventory.stock`. That column is the marketplace
 * reservation counter, decremented when a shop order is placed, and it is left
 * alone here. The two numbers answer different questions and the screens that
 * show both say which is which.
 *
 * A BILL RAISED FROM A CHALLAN MOVES NOTHING. The goods left when the challan
 * was written, so the sale line carries `from_challan_id` and the ledger skips
 * those lines. Without that the goods leave twice and both rows look correct
 * on their own. Tally ties the two together the same way, with a Tracking
 * Number.
 *
 * HOW A BILL COMES OUT OF ONE, and why it is not done here. The challan is
 * loaded INTO the sale or purchase form, where the wholesaler can adjust it,
 * and the ordinary sale or purchase path prices it. That is what Marg does:
 * modify the challan, press F7, and it loads into the bill screen. Converting
 * server-side would mean a second copy of the GST, cess, channel and
 * transport logic that `saleController` already holds, and two copies of
 * money arithmetic in this codebase is how the khata and the bill start
 * disagreeing. The form posts back the challan ids it used, and `stampBilled`
 * closes them in the same transaction that writes the sale.
