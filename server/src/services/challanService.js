/**
 * Raising a challan FROM a sale that is already in the book.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED IN PART, 17 SEPT 2026. This file was built on 10 Sept around a
 * rule that no longer holds: that an unpaid sale gets a challan INSTEAD of a
 * tax invoice, and the invoice waits for the money. The challan has since
 * been rebuilt as a movement document in services/challanBook.js, the way
 * Marg, Tally and Busy all have it, and `invoiceWaitsForPayment()` below now
 * defaults OFF.
 *
 * That reversal also fixed the part that was never compliant. Section 31(1)
 * ties the tax invoice to REMOVAL of the goods, not to payment, so holding it
 * back understated outward supply in GSTR-1 and left the customer unable to
 * claim input credit.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL LIVE HERE, and why it was not deleted: sending goods out
 * against a sale that has ALREADY been recorded. That is a real thing and the
 * order screen reaches it too. It just no longer asks whether anybody has
 * paid. A new challan typed from scratch, in either direction, goes through
 * challanBook instead.
 *
 * Rule 55 challans cover movement that is NOT a supply: job work, goods on
 * approval, quantity unknown at removal. Nothing here is written as one,
 * which is why every row carries is_rule_55 false and the printed document
 * says in plain words that it is not a tax invoice.

 * Tally and Busy all have it: goods moved, so a challan exists, and whether
 * anybody has paid has nothing to do with it. See services/challanBook.js.

 * Holding the invoice back was also the part that was never compliant.

 * this way may want the old behaviour until they have re-trained their
 * counter: CHALLAN_WHEN_UNPAID=true restores it exactly.
