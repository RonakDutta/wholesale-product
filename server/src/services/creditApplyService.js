/**
 * Setting a customer's credit against something he has ordered.
 *
 * A customer ends up in credit whenever money stays with the wholesaler after
 * the goods stop being owed: an order cancelled after payment, a return
 * completed before the refund goes out, an overpayment. The Overview has
 * always told the wholesaler what to do about it, in these words:
 *
 *     "They paid for something that was cancelled or came back.
 *      Refund it, or set it against their next order."
 *
 * Nothing implemented the second half. The credit could only sit there, and
 * because the khata is one running balance per customer it was netted against
 * whatever was billed next, which made it look spent when it was not:
 *
 *     he returns a 2 lakh order, unrefunded   you owe him 2,00,000
 *     he orders 4 lakh and pays half          he owes 0        <- looks square
 *     he pays the other half                  you owe him 2,00,000
 *
 * Every one of those figures is arithmetically right. The trouble is the
 * middle one: he was asked to pay the whole 4 lakh while 2 lakh of his money
 * was already in the till, so the credit was never spent, only hidden, and it
 * came back the moment the bill was settled. A wholesaler reading that says
 * "he owed me nothing, then he paid me, and now I owe him 2 lakh".
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO
 *
 * It does not invent a payment. Writing a fresh party_payments row for the
 * credited amount would count the same rupees twice: they are already in
 * `received` for this customer, which is the whole reason he is in credit. The
 * balance would swing further into his favour and the problem would double
 * rather than close.
 *
 * What it does is re-address money that is already there. The rows behind the
 * credit are payments no live sale is standing against any more, and they are
 * pointed at the sale the wholesaler chooses. Same rupees, same customer, same
 * total received; only the goods they are set against change. So:
 *
 *   - the customer's balance does not move, which is right, because nothing
 *     has happened between the two of them
 *   - the chosen sale reads as paid, because it now is
 *   - the credit is spent, and cannot come back
 *
 * The order behind the sale is told as well, because every downstream rule
 * reads orders.amount_paid to decide whether goods may go out on a challan and
 * whether the bill may be raised. An order settled from credit is settled: the
 * customer handed the money over, just earlier and for something else.

 * he ordered again, his 2 lakh of credit was cancelled out by the 2 lakh he
 * now owed and his page read zero. Asking the balance "how much credit does he
 * have" answers "none", while 2 lakh of his money is plainly still in the till.
 *
 * So the credit is measured as what it actually is: the payments no live goods
 * are standing against. Those are real rows with real dates, they add up to
 * real money, and billing him for something else does not make them go away.
 *
 * This can understate and never overstates. Money overpaid against a sale that
 * is still live is credit too, in principle, and is not counted here: it is
 * doing a job against that sale, and taking it away would unsettle a bill that
 * reads as paid. If that case ever needs handling it is a different button.
