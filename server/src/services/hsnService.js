/**
 * HSN codes, kept to what can actually be checked.
 *
 * An HSN code is the number that says what a thing IS on a tax document. It
 * is printed on every invoice line, and above ₹5 crore turnover it has to be
 * six digits rather than four. Get it wrong and the bill misdescribes the
 * goods, which is the customer's problem as much as the wholesaler's, because
 * it is what he claims his input credit against.
 *
 * Three things are done here, and only three, because only three can be done
 * honestly without a paid data source:
 *
 *   the shape       a code is 4, 6 or 8 digits. Nothing else is a code, and
 *                   this catches a slipped keystroke on the spot.
 *   his own history what this wholesaler has typed before, which is by far
 *                   the best suggestion available: he sells the same goods
 *                   every week and he already classified them once.
 *   a short list    common textile headings, offered as a starting point for
 *                   a wholesaler who has never entered one.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here: a rate table. Nothing maps an HSN to a GST
 * percentage in this file and nothing should. Rates change, the same heading
 * carries different rates by price slab, and a rate presented as authoritative
 * puts a wrong tax on a legal document. The rate stays where it is, a number
 * the wholesaler sets on his own listing.
 *
 * The curated list below is a starting point, not an authority. It is common
 * knowledge about the textile chapters, not a licensed dataset, and the screen
 * says so: a wholesaler is told to check a suggestion against his own goods,
 * never that it has been verified.
