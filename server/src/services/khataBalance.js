/**
 * What a customer owes, defined once.
 *
 * This used to live in partyController alone, and overviewController answered
 * the same question its own way. The two disagreed, and not harmlessly: the
 * Overview billed from sales but subtracted every payment including the ones
 * taken through the shop, so a wholesaler whose customers had paid through
 * the marketplace was shown a NEGATIVE amount still to collect. The money was
 * taken off the total and the debt behind it was never added on.
 *
 * So the rule lives here now and both screens read it. If a third screen ever
 * needs a balance, it reads it from here too.
 *
 * The rule itself:
 *
 *   billed   confirmed and delivered sales,
 *            plus marketplace orders that are genuinely owed and have not
 *            yet produced a sale of their own
 *   less     every payment in party_payments, whichever way it came in
 *
 * An accepted order writes itself a sale, and from that moment the sale is
 * the commercial record. Counting both would bill the same goods twice, so an
 * order that has produced a sale is skipped on the orders side.
 */

/**
 * The order statuses that do NOT mean money is owed.
 *
 * An order is a request before it is a debt. A basket abandoned at the payment
 * screen must not appear in a customer's khata, and neither must one that was
 * cancelled, refunded, or whose goods have come back.
 *
 * return_rejected is deliberately absent: the wholesaler refused the return,
 * so the customer still has the goods and still owes for them.
 *
 * Kept as a list of what is NOT owed rather than what is, because a status
 * added later is far more likely to be another step of a live order than
 * another way for one to die, and the safer default is to count it.

 *
 * Two customers make the point. Ramesh owes 5,000. Suresh paid for an order
 * that was later cancelled and is 2,000 in credit. The old figure said 3,000,

 * is out there to collect, and 2,000 of somebody else's money is sitting in

 *
 * Netting them also lets one customer's credit hide another's debt, which is
 * the failure that matters: a wholesaler chasing 5,000 is shown 3,000 and
 * stops chasing early.
 *
 * So each customer's balance is worked out on its own and only then added up,
 * the debts into one figure and the credits into another. "Still to collect"
 * becomes structurally incapable of going negative, and the money owed back is
 * reported rather than quietly cancelled out. Neither number is invented and
