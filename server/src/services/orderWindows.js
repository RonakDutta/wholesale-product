 *      a question about status, not about the clock.
 *   2. Return. Open for seven days after delivery. That is this file: the
 *      lifecycle alone cannot answer it, because `delivered` is `delivered`
 *      whether the goods arrived this morning or last February.
 *   3. Nothing. After that the order is closed and stays closed.
 *
 * Before this, door two never shut. An order delivered a year ago could still
 * be sent back, and the wholesaler had no ground to stand on when he said no.
