/**
 * Which state is this person in?
 *
 * One question, asked in one place, because the answer decides whether a bill
 * charges CGST plus SGST or IGST, and that is a number on a legal document.
 *
 * It used to be asked three different ways. The invoice service read
 * `warehouse_state || warehouse_city || city || "Delhi"`, the sale invoice
 * service read a slightly different chain, and gstService then guessed a state
 * from whichever of those turned up by looking the city up in a hand written
 * map of about fifty metros. Three chains and a guess, deciding tax.
 *
 * The order below is by how much each source actually knows:
 *
 *   1. what he declared    the state he typed into his own settings, or the
 *                          state on the customer's card. Somebody sat down and
 *                          said this, so it wins.
 *   2. his GST number      the first two digits of a GSTIN ARE the state. This
 *                          is not a guess or a lookup, it is what the number
 *                          means, and it is right even when the address is
 *                          half filled in.
 *   3. his city            the old map, kept as a last resort, because a book
 *                          full of customers entered as "Surat" with no state
 *                          and no GST number should still bill correctly.
 *
 * When nothing answers, the answer is null, and null is not a state. Read
 * `isIntraState` for what that then does, because "we do not know" and "they
 * are in the same state" are not the same fact and the old code treated both
 * as Delhi.
