/**
 * How much has actually come in against one sale.
 *
 * One rule, in one place, because three screens were each keeping their own
 * copy of it and no two agreed.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. A sale written from a shop order has money in two places:
 *
 *   orders.amount_paid    what the buyer paid at checkout
 *   party_payments        rows in the wholesaler's khata
 *
 * and the khata holds two KINDS of row, which is the part that was missed:
 *
 *   a mirror of the shop payment, written by partyService with order_id and
 *   payment_transaction_id set, so the customer's balance is right
 *
 *   money the wholesaler took himself and typed in, written by recordPayment
 *   with a sale_id and neither of those
 *
 * Adding the khata rows to orders.amount_paid counts the shop payment twice,
 * because the mirror IS that payment. That is the fault this rule was written
 * to avoid, and it was avoided by taking the GREATER of the two instead.
 *
 * But GREATEST has the opposite fault, and it is worse. A wholesaler who takes
 * the second instalment in cash and records it in the khata adds a row that
 * never exceeds orders.amount_paid on its own, so the greater of the two is
 * still the order's figure and the cash is swallowed whole. The sale never
 * settles, the bill is never raised, and the customer's page says he is square
 * while the sale page says he still owes. That is the same complaint a
 * wholesaler made on 11 Sept about the other direction, arriving by the other
 * road.
 *
 * THE RULE. Take the order's figure, and add only the khata rows that did not
 * come from the shop:
 *
 *   received = orders.amount_paid
 *            + SUM(party_payments for this sale that carry no order_id and no
 *              payment_transaction_id)
 *
 * Neither kind is counted twice and neither is dropped. A sale with no order
 * behind it has no orders.amount_paid, so it is simply the sum of its rows.
 *
 * Capped at the sale total by the callers that need a balance, not here: this
 * answers what came in, and a genuine overpayment is a fact worth seeing.

/**
 * The khata rows that are NOT a mirror of a shop payment.
 *
 * order_id is what tells them apart. Every mirror is written with it set, by
 * partyService on a live payment and by backfill_order_payments.js on the old
 * ones; a row the wholesaler typed in himself has a sale_id and no order_id.
 *
 * payment_transaction_id is deliberately NOT part of this test. Setting a
 * customer's credit against a bill re-addresses a mirror row to a different
 * sale and clears its order_id, because it no longer represents that order's
 * payment, but it keeps the transaction id so the trail back to the original
 * money survives. Testing both columns would have read those rows as mirrors
 * for ever and the applied credit would have counted for nothing.
