/**
 * Sale and delivery challan numbers, in one place.
 *
 * There were two copies of the sale numbering, one in saleController for a
 * sale the wholesaler types and one in orderSaleService for a sale written
 * when an order is accepted. Changing the shape in one of them and not the
 * other is exactly what happened on 12 Sept: sales from the sales book got the
 * new number and sales from an accepted order crashed on an ON CONFLICT that
 * no longer matched. Two copies of a rule is how this codebase has been bitten
 * repeatedly, so there is one now.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. S/1/26-27 and DC/1/26-27, restarting each 1 April, which is the
 * same shape the invoice uses. All three used to differ:
 *
 *   invoice   INV-000001   restarts yearly
 *   sale      S-0001       never restarts
 *   challan   DC-0001      never restarts
 *
 * Three documents describing the same goods, three shapes, three padding
 * widths, and no year on any of them.
 *
 * Unlike the invoice this is not a legal requirement. Rule 46(b) constrains a
 * tax invoice; a sale is the wholesaler's own record and a challan under this
 * product's rule is explicitly not a tax document. The reason is legibility,
 * not law.
 *
 * BOTH FALL BACK. Until wholesale3_series_financial_year.sql is run the old
 * shapes are produced, because migrations here are applied by hand and a sale
 * that cannot be written is far worse than one numbered the old way.
 *
 * Must be called inside a transaction: the upsert locks the counter row until
 * commit, which is what stops two sales taking the same number.
 */

/**
 * Refused because the number itself is not legal, not because the server broke.
