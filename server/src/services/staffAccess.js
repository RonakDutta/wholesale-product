/**
 * Who is acting, and whose book they are acting on.
 *
 * A wholesaler does not sit at the counter all day. His nephew takes orders,
 * his munim writes the sales and his driver marks deliveries, and until now
 * every one of them had to use the owner's own login. That is not a small
 * inconvenience: nothing in the history could say who did what, and the owner
 * could not take the login back from somebody who had left.
 *
 * Two ideas, kept apart on purpose.
 *
 *   the person    who is signed in. Owns the history entries, receives the
 *                 notifications, is the name against a dispatch.
 *   the business  whose customers, sales, stock and money are being worked on.
 *
 * For an owner these are the same id, which is why the difference was never
 * visible and why `req.user.id` was used for both. For an employee they are
 * different, and every query that means "the business" and reads the person
 * instead will either show him an empty book or, worse, somebody else's.
 */

/**
 * What an employee can be allowed to do.
 *
 * Named for the job rather than the screen, because permissions outlive
 * layouts. The labels are what the owner reads on the staff page, so they are
 * plain: a man deciding what his nephew may touch should not have to work out
 * what "manage inventory entities" means.
