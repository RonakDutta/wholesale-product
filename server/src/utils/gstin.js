/**
 * Checking a GSTIN without paying anybody.
 *
 * There is no free government API that turns a GSTIN into a business name.
 * The lookups that do exist are resold by GST Suvidha Providers and every one
 * of them is metered. What is free, and what catches almost every mistake a
 * person actually makes, is the number's own arithmetic: a GSTIN carries a
 * check digit, so a mistyped one can be caught on the spot with no network
 * call, no key, no account and no rupee.
 *
 * What this does NOT tell you: whether the business exists, whether the
 * registration is live, or whose it is. A number can be perfectly formed and
 * belong to nobody. Anything that says "verified" on the strength of this
 * alone is lying, so nothing here uses that word.
 *
 * The shape, all 15 characters:
 *
 *   27        state code, 01 to 38, plus 97 for offshore and 99 for a UN body
 *   AAPFU0939F PAN, five letters, four digits, one letter
 *   1         which registration this is for that PAN, 1 to 9 then A to Z
 *   Z         fixed by the rules
 *   V         the check digit, computed from the other fourteen
